# [Aid Platform](https://aid-platform-frontend.vercel.app/)

##### A web application for the neighborhood, the users can post a request to get help from their neighbors. <br/>

- the requests are displayed on leafletjs map with custom markers.<br/>
- The users are located automatically once logged in and can see only the unfulfilled requests near them or when dragging the map get more posts.
- Upon clicking the fulfill button to fulfill the need, the volunteer is sent into a message flow where they can send a message to the requester directly on the platform. The requester and the volunteer can communicate this way to organize fulfillment of the need.
- If, within 24 hours, the request still hasn't been marked as fulfilled, all unfulfilled requests will be marked as expired and after that, the requester can republish it.
